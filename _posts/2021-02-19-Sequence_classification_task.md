After procrastinating and doing 3 hours worth of work in 5 days, I've decided to not sleep until I finish this task. 
I will keep posting results as I work along just to gamify this process and make it fun.

The task is sequence classification using transfer learning on Language models. I will be trying an 
ensemble approach where the results of two models, Roberta and ULMFIT, will be ensembled and final classification will be done using a third model.

The data is in Dutch and consists of legal documents and I have no clue what they're about. The original task is multi-class 
classification but for now, I shall stick to binary classification of only one class in order to set a benchmark.

Also, I am sleep deprived and hungry and cranky.
