# About

I do applied ML - basically read some research papers and try to solve the given problem using new ideas and simple hacks. I enjoy the half-research-half-application form of ML work the most. Often XBGoost can solve a lot of your problems AFTER you've figured out the best way to represent your data.

Another interest of mine is model compression. Big models are too slow to work with for most people who only have access to limited compute resources.
